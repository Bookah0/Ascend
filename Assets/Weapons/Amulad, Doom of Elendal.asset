  flavorText: Newborn legend says that King Kalvan crushed Elendal, the Voice of
    Leaves and king of forests under the force of this warhammer. Countless wooden
    chips flooded the ground of which Kalvan later fueled his fires of victory with.
    In truth it was Lenna, Left hand of the King that was suited in the Kings golden
    armor that dim night and it was she who fell the living tree. The King sitting
    idle far away from any harm.
