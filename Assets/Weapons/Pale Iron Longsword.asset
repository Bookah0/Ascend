  flavorText: Pale iron, or "commoners iron" as its known by Pieniar weaponsmiths
    is the affordable alternative to Pure and regular iron. It, just as Pure iron
    isn't actual iron but metal the Pieniar discovered during the Vale Expansion
    when deposits grew short. To the naked eye it has the appearance its pure counterpart
    which, in the past had created large trade disputes throughout all of Delman
    as commoners became rich from selling these dull swords.
