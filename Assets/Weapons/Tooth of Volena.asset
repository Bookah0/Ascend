  flavorText: With his party slaughtered, he fled. Mienar, Idroian slayer of Ydelvra
    brought nothing home but a single tooth, not the head that was ordered of him.
    He voued to slay the beast with the very thing that was coated with the blood
    of his comrades. However, that day would never come. As Volenas whispers grew
    louder and louder Mienars mind broke.
